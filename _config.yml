  Hi! I'm Suhas Chundi, a Machine Learning Research Engineer at Scale AI. This is a blog of things I find interesting in AI research. My goals with this blog are to 1) present research ideas in an accessible way to a semi-technical audience and 2) encourage me to read/implement more research. Hopefully you find it useful/interesting too!
